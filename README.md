# Book Sorting

This project uses the `Book` class from Homework Assignment for Lesson 45 (see `Book.java`).

## Usage

1. Create a list of books.
2. Sort the books by title and, in case of identical titles, by author using a lambda function.

## Implementation

The sorting is done using a lambda function to ensure books are ordered by title and author as needed.
